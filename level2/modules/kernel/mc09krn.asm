********************************************************************
* The memory block map is a data structure that is used to manage
* physical memory. Physical memory is assigned in 8Kbyte "blocks".
* 256 bytes are reserved for the map and so the maximum physical
* memory size is 256*8Kbyte=2Mbyte. D.BlkMap is a pointer to the
* start of the map (set to $0200, below). D.BlkMap+2 is a pointer
* to the end of the map. Rather than simply setting it to $0300,
* the end pointer is set by the memory sizing routine at L0111.
* (Presumably) this makes it faster to search for unused pages
* and also acts as the mechanism to avoid assigning non-existent
* memory. A value of 0 indicates an unused block and since the
* system block has been initialised to 0 (above) every block starts
* off marked as unused. Initial reservation of blocks occurs
* below, after the memory sizing.
* See "Level 2 flags" in os9.d for other byte values.

* (256 entries of 256 bytes is 64Kbytes). A value of 0 indicates
* an unused page and since the system block has been initialised
* to 0 (above) every page starts off marked as unused.
* See "Level 2 flags" in os9.d for other byte values.
