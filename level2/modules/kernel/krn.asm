* ------------------------------------------------------------------
*  19r6    2002/08/21  Boisy G. Pitre
* Assembles to the os9p1 module that works on my NitrOS-9 system.
*
*  19r7    2002/09/26  Boisy G. Pitre
* Added check for CRC feature bit in init module
*
*  19r8    2003/09/22  Boisy G. Pitre
* Back-ported to OS-9 Level Two.
*
*  19r8    2004/05/22  Boisy G. Pitre
* Renamed to 'krn'
*
*  19r9    2004/07/12  Boisy G. Pitre
* F$SRqMem now properly scans the DAT images of the system to update
* the D.SysMem map.
*
*  19r10   2019/11/15-2019/12/26  L. Curtis Boyle
* Optimized register stack copies on 6809 in 4 spots (Loop5, RtiLoop, Looper
*   & Loop4)
*   Saves over 70 cycles per system call that switches between user &
*   system states
* Changed F$Move to use D.IRQTmp to eliminate some TFR's, and changed it so
*   pshs cc/puls cc replace with orc #IntMask/andcc ^#IntMasks (faster)
* Also changed it to pulu routine again (for >64 byte copies, 14 cycles
*   faster per 8 bytes copied)
* Shrunk 6309 code by 1 byte in F$VModul
* 6309-Removed 2 BRN's from F$LDAXY, as they were not 2.01 source, and
*   don't appear to useful since F$LDDDXY does the same type of MMU mapping
*   without delays.
* Moved F$CpyMem from KrnP2, which allows shortcut bsr calls to F$Move,etc. Much,
*   much faster. (6809)
*
*  20r00   2023/10/17  Boisy Gene Pitre
* Ported to the Foenix F256.
*
*  20r01   2024/01/05  E. J. Jaquay
* Correct overlapping ifne f256 and ifne H6308 conditionals near line 163

* Kernel reserves 256 bytes for this map; therefore, the maximum physical
* memory size is 256*8KB=2MB.
* D.BlkMap is a pointer to the start of the map (set to $0200, below).
* D.BlkMap+2 is a pointer to the end of the map.
* Rather than simply setting it to $0300, the memory sizing routine sets
* the end pointer.
* Presumably, this makes it faster to search for unused pages, and also acts
* as a mechanism to avoid assigning non-existent memory. A value of 0 indicates
* an unused block. Since the system block is initialized to $0000 above, every
* block starts off marked as unused. The initial reservation of blocks occurs
* below, after the memory sizing.
* See "Level 2 flags" in os9.d for other byte values.
