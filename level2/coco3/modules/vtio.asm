********************************************************************
* VTIO - Video Terminal I/O Driver for CoCo 3
*
* Need to add SS.GIP2 as well (see notes in code below). May also want to add
* a new SetStat call to allow changing a device descriptor between CoVDG and CoWin
*   types (without needing XMODE)
* NOTE:  CODE ISSUES FOUND!!
* "Animate Palette?  This obviously isn't implemented yet"
* Look at this code.  Why is this calling an entry point in
* SNDDRV??? LCB note: Sound is usually driven by the same IRQ
*   (60hz) as the keyboard/joystick scan, and they have to link
*   together, so that may be why.

* ------------------------------------------------------------------
*  16      1986/??/??
* Original OS-9 L2 Tandy distribution.
*
*  26r3    1998/10/12
* Added support for obtaining monitor type from the init module.
*
*  26r4    1998/10/23
* Added support for obtaining key repeat info from the init module.
*
*  26r5    2002/07/24
* Added support for obtaining mouse info from the init module.
*
*  27      2003/08/18  Boisy G. Pitre
* Forward ported to NitrOS-9.
*
*          2003/11/16  Robert Gault
* Corrected several lines for keyboard mouse.
* Corrected several lines in SSMOUSE where MS.Side used incorrectly.
*
*          2003/12/02  Boisy G. Pitre
* Keyboard mouse is now either global or local to window, depending
* on whether GLOBALKEYMOUSE is defined.
*
*          2004/08/14  Boisy G. Pitre
* Fixed a bug where the last deiniz of the last window device caused
* an infinite loop.  The problem was that IOMan clears the static
* storage of a device whose use count has reached zero (in the
* case of a hard detach).  See Note below.
*
* Renamed to VTIO and reset edition to 1.
*
*   1      2006/03/04  Boisy G. Pitre
* Added detection of CTRL-ALT-BREAK to invoke system debugger.
* Renamed to VTIO and reset edition to 1.
*
*   2      2007/08/22  Boisy G. Pitre
* Fixed bug where an error other than E$MNF when linking to CoWin would be ignored.
* Now, if the error returned from linking CoWin is not E$MNF, we don't bother to look
* for CoGrf... we just return immediately.
*
*   3      2020/04/26 (EOU Beta 5)  L. Curtis Boyle
* Changed SS.GIP call (should be backwards compatible) to allow individual $FF settings
*   (leave current setting alone) to work for all 4 parameters independently.
* Also moved start branch table to allow short branches to Write and Getstat-they get called
*   a lot more often than Terminate
*   4      2020/06/20 (EOU Beta 6)  L. Curtis Boyle
* - Minor size/speed optimizations as mentioned in my earlier comments from Beta 5
* - Also fixed SS.ComSt SetStat - goes straight to CoVDG module, and now works.
* - Minor SS.Joy optimization
* - To facilitate other planned changes, Global Keyboard mouse is removed, with local
*     keyboard mouse only (also greatly helps beginners who don't understand why simple
*     things like backspace don't work anymore on other windows).
*   2020/07/15 LCB - started adding SS.GIP2 call.
*   2020/07/20 LCB - removed KeyMem 8 byte static mem buffer and references to it; it was
*     never used and just taking up space (and time to set it up)
*   2020/07/22 LCB - merged KeyDrv back into VTIO (only had 2 functions, and no static RAM
*     usage). Will save some module space, and saves 10 bytes of global mem total.
*   2020/07/22 LCB - Keyclick (local to each window) toggle working in SS.GIP2 call
*   2020/09/16 LCB - Enable/disable 2nd mouse button on active mouse port to be CLEAR
*     equivalent working (needs updated JoyDrv_Joy) option enabled in SS.GIP2 call.
*     Both Keyclick & CLEAR are 2 bits per setting:
*     0x = leave current setting
*     10 = disable feature
*     11 = enable feature
*   2020/12/18 LCB - still had text 'KeyDrv' in code, now removed (saves 6 bytes)

** PROPOSED in SS.GIP2 call - Use low byte of X for default font # (boot default is 1). $00
**  means leave alone

                    ttl       Video Terminal I/O Driver for CoCo 3
* Need to fix up ISR routine to handle Animate Palette. NOTE: the "screen hardware settings"
*   flag forces a call to SelNewWindow in the Co-driver, which should actually update:
*   1) screen mode
*   2) screen address
*   3) palettes

* LCB NOTE: Need to change this so that code always uses V.ULCASE static mem keyboard mouse flag,
* but code will copy current state to all terminals if Global settings is on (and this could
* use existing global G.KyMse for current "system state". SS.GIP2 call can add setting this to
* allow changing after booting (might want to add/modify a byte in the new INIT module so that
* the default setting comes from there). Or, have the code check if global enabled and use G.KyMse if
* it is, or V.ULCASE if not. (if latter, reserve 2 bits in G.KyMse; hi bit is global enabled, low bit
* is keyboard mouse turned on if global enabled.). NOTE: We can use the 3rd lowest bit in Feature1
* byte of INIT for the default Global keyboard mouse on/off flag.
* NOTE: Want to implement bit flags for local keyboard mouse & caps lock (like we did in TC-9), so
* that we can use 3 colors of LED on the Boomerang E2 2 MB board (add BOOMERANG equ) to signify
* Caps Lock on, Keyboard mouse on, and Caps Lock AND keyboard mouse on, for each window.
* currently proposing Red for keyboard mouse, green for capslock, and either Blue or White for Both.
* Maybe half intensity? (so AAx10000 where AA: 00="all", 01=Red, 10=Grn, 11=Blue)

* Bug fix by Boisy on 08/22/2007 - The three lines below were inserted to check to see
* the nature of the error that occurred fromfailing to link to CoWin/CoGrf.  Since CoWin/CoGrf
* also load GrfDrv, an error other than E$MNF might arise.  We expect an E$MNF if CoGrf is in
* place instead of CoWin, but any other error just gets blown away without the three lines below.
* Now, if any error other than E$MNF is returned from trying to link to CoWin, we don't bother trying
* to link to CoGrf... we just return the error as is.
