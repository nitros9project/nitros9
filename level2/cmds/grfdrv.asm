**            - In L0B79 (Move Buffer command), optimized to not PSHS/PULS
**              Y, use U instead for ptr (13 cyc faster/72 byte block, 5 bytes
**              shorter)
**            - Added LDU <$64 in L0E97, changed JSR [$>1164] in L0EE1 to

**   12/21/93 - Moved L1E9D to near next line routine to speed up some alpha
**              writes. Also used U instead of Y in L1E9D (smaller & a cycle
**              faster)
**   02/23/94 - Moved L0BE4 error routine earlier to allow short branch to it
**              from L0B3F (GPLoad), also optomized for no-error (5 cycles

**            - Moved INCB from L0E2F to L0E03 to allow L0E24 to fall through
**              faster (by also changing LDB #MaxLine to LDB #MaxLine+1)
**   04/21/94 - Change all occurences of >$1003 (last window GRFDRV accessed)

**            - Deleted L146F, moved label for it to PULS pc,a @ ClsFGfx
** ATD:
**   12/23/95 - have SCF put text-only data at $0180, and have new call
**              to grfdrv to do a block PUT of the text data.
**              Added new L0F4B, and labels L0F4B.1 and L0F4B.2
**              cuts by 40% the time required for alpha screen writes!
**   12/26/95 - moved Line/Bar/Box common code to i.line routine
**              +6C:-40B, only called once per entry, so it's OK
**   12/28/95 - added LBSR L0177 just before font set up routine at L1002
**              changed lbsr L0177, lbsr L1002 to lbsr L0FFF: gets +0C:-3B
**              par call from L1478, L116E, L1186, L1129
**            - replaced 3 lines of code at L1641, i.line, L1C4F with
**              lbsr L1884: map in window and verify it's graphics
**              it's only called once per iteration, so we get 3 of +11C:-6B
**   02/08/96 - added fast fonts on byte boundaries to L102F
**            - added TFM for horizontal line if LSET=0 and no PSET
**            - removed most of graphics screen CLS code for non-byte
**              boundary windows.  They don't exist, the code is unnecessary.
**            - changed many ADDR D,r  to LEAr D,r where speed was unimportant
**   02/13/96 - fixed font.2 routine to properly handle changes in foreground
**              and background colors: ~13 bytes smaller. (other changes???)
**            - added special code to fast horizontal line routine at L16E0
**              to do the line byte by byte: saves a few cycles, but 2B larger
**   02/14/96 - added 'ldu <$64' U=pset vector to i.line, bar/box. -6 bytes,
**              and timed at -18 clock cycles/byte for XOR to full-screen
**              or 14/50 = 0.28 second faster per screen (iteration)
**  02/16/96  - shrunk code for $1F handler. Smaller and faster.
**  02/18/96  - Discovered that NitrOS-9 will allow GetBlk and PutBlk on
**              text screens!  Checked: GET on text and PUT on gfx crashes
**              the system, ditto for other way around.  Stock OS-9 does NOT
**              allow PutBlk or GetBlk on text! No error, but no work, either.
**            - Added code to PutBlk to output E$IWTyp if mixing txt and gfx
**              GetBlk/PutBlk, but we now allow Get and put on text screens.
**  02/20/96  - minor mods to update video hardware at L08A4: use U
**            - Added 'L1B63 LDD #1' to replace multiple LDD #1/lbsr L1B64
**            - moved code around to optimize for size in arc/ellipse/circle
**              without affecting speed at all.
**  02/24/96  - added special purpose code for LSET AND, OR, XOR and NO PSET
**              to put pixels 2 bytes at a time... full-screen BAR goes from
**              1.4 to .35 seconds, adds ~75 bytes.
**            - Added code to check for 24/25 line windows in video set code
**              from DWSET: Wt.DfSZY=24 uses old 192 line video defs
**  02/25/96  - removed 24/25-line check code, optimized video hardware update
**  02/26/96  - fixed fast TFM and XOR (double byte) horizontal line to
**              update <$47 properly
**            - rearranged BOX routine to cut out extra X,Y updates
**  02/29/96  - optimized BOX routine: smaller and marginally faster
**  03/05/96  - moved PSET setup routines to L1884 for Point, Line, Bar, Box
**              Arc, Circle, Ellipse, and FFill.
**            - modified FFILL to do left/right checking, and right painting
**              to do byte operations, if possible.  Speeds up FFILL by >20%
**  03/07/96  - modified FFILL to search (not paint) to the right, and to
**              call the fast horizontal line routine. 2-color screen FFILLs
**              take 1/10 the time of v1.22k: 16-color takes 1/2 of the time!
**  03/17/96  - added TFM and left/right pixel fixes so non-PSET/LSET odd
**              pixel boundary PutBlks can go full-speed.
**  03/18/96  - optimized the fast-font routine.  16-color screens ~5% faster
**  04/05/96  - addeed special-purpose hardware text screen alpha put routine
**              about 30% faster than before: 5 times over stock 'Xmas GrfDrv'
**            - merged cursor On/Off routines at L157A: smaller, ~10c slower
**            - saved 1 byte in invert attribute color routine
**            - moved FastHTxt routine (i.e. deleted it: smaller, 3C slower)
**            - L0516 and L0581: added 'xy.intoq' routine to set up X,Y size
**              for text/graphics screens
** V2.00a changes (LCB)
** 05/25/97-05/26/97 - added code to support 224 char fonts on graphics
**            screens
**          - Changed 3 LBSR's to BSR's (@ L01B5,L1BB4,L1D40)
** 12/02/97 - Attempted to fix GetBlk, PutBlk & GPLoad to handle full width
**            lines @ L0BAE (GetBlk), L0CBB (PutBlk),
**            NOTE: TO SAVE SPACE GRFDRV, MAYBE HAVE CoWin DO THE INITIAL
**              DEC ADJUSTMENTS, AND JUST DO THE INC'S IN GRFDRV
** 07/10/98 - Fixed OWSet/CWArea bug: changed DECB to DECD @ L05C0
** 07/21/98 - Fixed screen wrap on CWAREA or Overlay window on hardware text
**            screens by adding check @ ftxt.ext
** 07/28/98 - Fixed FFill "infinite loop" bug (See SnakeByte game), I think.
** 07/30/98 - Filled Circle/Ellipse added ($1b53 & $1b54)
** Repository changes (RG)
** 09/17/03 - Added trap for windows overlapping 512K bank; RG.
**            Required changing a bsr L0306 to lbsr L0306 near L02A7
** 09/25/03 - Many changes for 6809 only code. Use <$B5 to store regW
**            Probably could use some trimming. RG
** 02/26/07 - Changed Line routine to improve symmetry. The changes will permit
**            the removal of the FastH and FastV routines if desired. The new
**            Normal Line will correctly draw horizontal or vertical lines. RG
**     NOTE: THIS CHANGE HAS CAUSED DISTORTIONS ON SOME PROGRAMS (NOTABLY, SHAWN
**           DRISCOLL'S GUIB Diamond
** EOU Beta 1 changes - Hardware transparency re-enabled, as per Version 3.0 upgrade.
**            (allows using transparency switch to switch between current background
**             colour setting, and leaving background color currently at text printing
**             location.
** EOU Beta 2 changes (LCB)
** 11/13/18 - Fixed (along with CoWin) to allow grfdrv loaded outside of system map (BN)
** 11/21/18 - Started changes (mostly for 6809 version) to use new DP address <grScrtch
**            for immediate temp storage instead of stack (saves 4 cycles per save/restore
**            or save/manipulate/check (LCB). Done in get.font, L01E0, L01FB, L0206,L023A,
**            L0256
** 11/21/18 - Implemented mini-stack blast clear routine (4 byte even version only so far)
**            used by screen clear (both text and graphics modes) in DWSet, and resetting
**            all palettes to black when DWEnding last window on a screen.
** 11/26/18 - Implemented StkBlCpy routine used for screen scrolling, PutBlk and GPLoad for
**            6809.
** EOU Beta 3 changes (LCB)
** 12/02/18 - Implemented StkBlClr routine used for CLS, clear to end of line, clear to end
**            of screen for full width text screens. Both 6809 & 6309
** 12/03/18 - Implemented StkBlClr routine used for CLS, clear to end of line, clear to end
**            of screen for partial width graphics screens (6809)
** EOU Beta 4 changes (LCB)
** 12/24/18 - Attempted to optimize StkBlClr for 1-3 byte leftovers to be two bytes smaller,
**            and 1/2 (6309) or 2/4 cycles (6809) faster
** 03/11/19 - Implemented Erik Gavriluk's more mathematically accurate composite color
**            conversion table at L0884
** EOU Beta 5 changes (LCB)
** 06/24/19 - Shrunk main entry routine by 2 bytes
**          - Removed unneeded std in L0366 (Window init/6809)
**          - shrunk/sped up L03A9 by removing un-needed std <$B5
** 06/27/19 - 6809 - replaced MUL16 routine (unsigned, which breaks ARC) with original
**            routine (with some mods for NitrOS-9) with signed 16x16=24 bit (sign extended
**            to 32 bit), which fixes ARC bug (from at least 2006). This only affected
**            diagonal clip lines with mixed signs. (LCB)
** 06/28/19 - 6309 - Fixed clear graphics screen (not window) routine, which was getting the
**            byte to clear with from the wrong memory location. (LCB)
** 06/30/19 - 6809 - Optimized scaling routine @ L05E7 for both speed & size (LCB)
** 04/26/20 - Both 6809/6309 - optimize text out routine to test for no hi bit characters
**            *before* calling txt.fixa. Will make code 4 bytes bigger, but speed up text
**            output for non-high bit characters by 10 (6309) or 12 (6809) cycles per char.
** EOU Beta 6 changes (LCB)
** 07/31/20 - Slightly shrunk Nano vertical screen size checks @ L01E0
** 08/06/20 - Optimized mini stack blast copy routine (6809) to 8 bytes/chunk. Speeds up
**             scrolling,etc. especially for full width screen scrolls. Also wide get/put
**             buffers, palette copies (may have to change anyways for VSYNC "snow" issues)
**             and, to a lesser extend, GPLoad). LCB
** 08/24/20 - Hacked a workaround to possible "infinite loop" FFill's with patterns. It now
**            has a sanity check that will exit (usually with a stack overflow error) if this
**            is happening. Only happens with certain patterns, and complex, large fill areas.
**          - Also sped up proportional and 6 pixel wide fonts slightly for both CPU's (up to
**            several percent).
**          - Optimized wide LSet's to be slightly faster for both CPU's as well.
** EOU Beta 6.0.1 changes (LCB)
** 12/29/20 - Fixed bug on Y clipping in PutBlk @ L0D30 - changed BLO to BLS
** 01/07/20 - Slight speed increase for double byte drawing with XOR,AND,OR Logic.

* If you know that you are doing even 4 byte multiple, you will need D & Y pushed to the stack
*   and enter with X being the end copy address (for source)
* Entry: D=size of copy
*        U=Source ptr
*        Y=Dest ptr
* Exit: U=ptr to end of source
*       Y=ptr to end of dest
* X not preserved!
