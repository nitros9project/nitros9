You get the source so you can modifythe code. Frankly I think the tutorial value alone of allthat source is worth the suggested $20. donation.(It's about 45 pages and just about every line is commented)How do you get it? 1) Send me $20 and I'll send you a disk.2) Until 1 June if you send me a disk and a SASE i'll sendyou the program so you can try it first. 3) I'll be sendingit to the os9/UG so you can get it thru them after theusual time lapse.
