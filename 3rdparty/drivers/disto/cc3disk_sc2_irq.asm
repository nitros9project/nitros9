* CC3Disk - Disto No Halt Super Controller II disk driver

* This driver their interrupt driven driver. It is a no halt
* (multitasking) disk driver that uses interrupts. Care must be

* NOTE: This driver only uses one byte of V.TRAK, and the most significiant
*   one, not the LSB as most others do.

* $FF48: READ = Status register Error flags are the most significiant 5 bits
*   %10000000 = Drive not ready
*   %01000000 = Write protect
*   %00100000 = Head is loaded OR Write fault (after any write operation)
*   %00010000 = Seek error
*   %00001000 = CRC error
*   %00000100 = Track 0 (head is @ track 0) OR Lost Data
*   %00000010 = Data Request (need to read or write data register)
*   %00000001 = Busy (command in progress)
* $FF48: WRITE = Command register
*   $03 = Restore
*   $17 = Seek
*   $23 = Step
*   $43 = Step in
*   $53 = Step out
*   $80 = Read sector
*   $a0 = Write sector
*   $c0 = Read Address
*   $e4 = Read Track
*   $f4 = Write Track
*   $d0 = Force interrupt

* $FF40: Control register - WRITE ONLY
*   %10000000 = Halt Flag: 0=Disabled (Wiggle for read/write sync)
*   %01000000 = Select drive 4 / Select side 2
*   %00100000 = Single (1) or Double density (0)
*   %00010000 = Write Precomp select (1)=ON

*   %00000001 = Select drive 1

* $FF49: Track register
* $FF4A: Sector register
* $FF4B: Data register (both directions)

* $FF76: Cache control register
*   %00000000 = Caching off
*   %00001000 = Tell cache controller to send interrupt when device is ready
*               to send/receive a buffer (seek done, etc.)
*   %00000111 = Read cache on - Get next 256 data bytes from controller to cache
*   %00000100 = Write cache on - Next 256 bytes stored in cache are sector
*   %00000110 = Copy Write cache to controller
* $FF74-$FF75 - cache data (read/write): Works the same as WDDisk/Eliminator,
*   with 'ghosting' technique to allow 2 byte read/writes. Should work with
*   TFM on first location
