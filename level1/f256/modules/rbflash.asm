* SST39LF/VF010 Device ID = D5H, is read with A0 = 1.
* SST39LF/VF020 Device ID = D6H, is read with A0 = 1.
* SST39LF/VF040 Device ID = D7H, is read with A0 = 1.
*
* Translation: The value we read from $6000 contains:
*  MSB = Manufacturer's ID = $BF (Microchip Technology - SST)
*  LSB = Device ID = $DF = 128KB of Flash
*                    $D6 = 256KB of Flash <----- Foenix Flash cartridge
*                    $D7 = 512KB of Flash
*
* In summary: We better see $BFD6 or $BFD7 as the chip ID.

* 3.3 Sector Erase Operation
* The Sector Erase operation allows the system to erase
* the device on a sector-by-sector basis. The sector
* architecture is based on uniform sector size of
* 4 Kbytes. The Sector Erase operation is initiated by
* executing a six-byte command load sequence for
* Software Data Protection with Sector Erase command
* (30H) and Sector Address (SA) in the last bus cycle.
* The sector address is latched on the falling edge of the
* sixth WE# pulse, while the command (30H) is latched
* on the rising edge of the sixth WE# pulse. The internal
* Erase operation begins after the sixth WE# pulse. The
* End-of-Erase can be determined using either Data#
* Polling or Toggle Bit methods. See Figure 7-6 for timing
* waveforms. Any commands written during the Sector
* Erase operation will be ignored.
