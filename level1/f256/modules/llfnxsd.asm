* LSNMap
* Take the physical LSN and convert into an SDHC/SD/MMC LSN.
* An SD/MMC card uses a 32 bit byte mapping for the LSN, so we must shift the logical LSN up one bit
* then clear the 4th byte to build the correct LSN string.
* An SDHC card uses a 32 bit 512 byte sector mapping for the LSN, so there is no need to shift the LSN.
* We can just write it as-is and clear out the upper LSN byte, because we only get 3 bytes for the LSN.
