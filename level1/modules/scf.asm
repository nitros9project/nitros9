********************************************************************
* SCF - NitrOS-9 Sequential Character File Manager
*
* This contains an added SetStat call to allow placing prearranged data
* into the keyboard buffer of ANY SCF related device.
*
* Usage:
*
* Entry: X = Pointer to the string
*        Y = Length of the string
*        A = Path number
*        B = SS.Fill ($A0) (syscall SETSTAT function call number)
* NOTE: If high bit of Y is set, no carriage return will be appended to
*       the read buffer (used in Shellplus V2.2 history)
*
* This also includes Kevin Darlings SCF Editor patches.

* Edt/Rev  YYYY/MM/DD  Modified by
* Comment
* ------------------------------------------------------------------
*          1993/04/20  ???
* V1.09:
* - Speeded up L05CC (write char to device) routine by a few cycles
* - Slightly optimized Insert char.
* - Move branch table so Read & ReadLn are 1 cycle faster each; fixed
*   SS.Fill so size is truncated @ 256 bytes.
* - Added NO CR option to SS.Fill (for use with modified Shellplus V2.2
*   command history).
*
*          1993/04/21  ???
* Slight speedup to some of ReadLn parsing, TFM's in Open/Close.
* - More optimization to read/write driver calls
* - Got rid of branch table @ L05E3 for speed
*
*          1993/05/21  ???
* V1.10:
* Added Boisy Pitre's patch for non-sharable devices.
* - Saved 4 cycles in routine @ L042B
* - Modified Boisy's routine to not pshs/puls B (saves 2 cycles).
* - Changed buffer prefill of CR's to save 1 byte.
*
*          1993/07/27  ???
* V1.11:
* Changed a BRA to a LBRA to a straight LBRA in L0322.
* - Optimized path option character routine @ L032C
*
*          1993/08/03  ???
* Modified vector table @ L033F to save 1 cycle on PD.PSC
* - Sped up uppercase conversion checks for ReadLn & WritLn
* - Changed 2 BRA's to L02F9 to do an LBRA straight to L05F8 (ReadLn loop)
* - Moved L0565 routine so Reprint line, Insert & Delete char (on ReadLn)
*   are 1 cycle faster / char printed
* - Changed 2 references to L0420 to go straight to L0565
* - Sped up ReadLn loop by 2 or 3 cycles per char read
*
*          1993/09/21  ???
* V1.12:
* Sped up L0435 by 1 or 2 cycles (depending on branch)
* - Changed LDD ,S to TFR X,D (saves 1 cycle) @ L04F1 (Write & WritLn)
* - Modified L04F1 to use W without TFR (+1 byte, -3 cycles) (Write)
*
*          1993/11/09  ???
* Took LDX #0/LDU PD.BUF,y from L03B5 & merged in @ L028A, L02EF & L0381.
* Also changed BEQ @ L03A5 to skip re-loading X with 0.
*
*          1993/11/10  ???
* Moved L04B2 routine to allow a couple of BSR's instead of LBSR's In READ.
* - Moved driver call right into READ loop (should save 25 cycles/char read)
* - Moved driver call right into L0565 (should save 12 cycles/char written on echo,
*   line editing, etc.)
*
*          1993/11/26  ???
* Moved L02FE (ReadLn parsing) to end where ReadLn routine is moved L03E2
* so Read loop would be optimized for it (read char from driver) instead of
* L042B (write filled buffer to caller).
* Changed LDA #C$NULL to CLRA.
*
*          1993/12/01  ???
* Modified device write call (L056F) to preserve Y as well, to cut down on
* PSHS/PULS.
* - Changed L03E2 & L03DA to exit immediately if PD.DEV or PD.DV2 (depending
* on which routine) is empty (eliminated redundant LEAX ,X).
*
*          1994/05/31  ???
* Attempted mode to L03F1 to eliminate LDW #D$READ, changed:
*      LDX V$DRIV,x
*      ADDW M$Exec,x
*      JSR w,x
* to:
*      LDW V$DRIV,x
*      ADDW M$Exec,w
*      JSR D$READ,w
* Did same to L05C9 & L056F (should speed up each by 1 cycle)
*
*          1994/06/07  ???
* Attempted to modify all M$Exec calls to use new V$DRIVEX (REQUIRES NEW IOMAN)
* - L01FA (Get/SetStat), L03F1 (Read), L05C9 (Write), L056F (Write)
* - Changed L046A to use LDB V.BUSY,x...CMPB ,s...TFR B,A
*
*          1994/06/08  ???
* Changed TST <PD.EKO,y in read loop (L02BC) to LDB PD.EKO,y
* - Changed LEAX 1,X to LDB #1/ABX @ L02C4
* - Changed LEAX >L033F,pc @ L032C to use < (8 bit) version
* - Modified L02E5 to use D instead of X, allowing TSTA, and faster exit on 0 byte
*   just BRAnching to L0453
*
*          1994/06/09  ???
* Changed LEAX 1,X to LDB #1/ABX @ L053D, L05F8, L0312, L0351, L03B8
* - Changed to L0573: All TST's changed to LDB's
* - Changed Open/Create init to use LEAX,PC instead of BSR/PULS X
* - Changed TST PD.CNT,y to LDA PD.CNT,y @ close
* - Eliminated L010D, changed references to it to go to L0129
* - Eliminated useless LEAX ,X @ L0182, and changed BEQ @ L0182 to go to L012A
*   instead of L0129 (speeds CLOSE by 5 or 10 cycles)
* - Moved L06B9 into L012B, eliminate BSR/RTS, plus
* - Changed TST V.TYPE,x to LDB V.TYPE,x
* - Moved L0624 to just before L05F8 to eliminate BRA L05F8 (ReadLn)
* - Changed TST PD.EKO,y @ L0413 to LDB PD.EKO,y

*          2002/10/11  Boisy G. Pitre
* Merged NitrOS-9 and TuneUp versions for single-source maintenance.  Note that
* the 6809 version of TuneUp never seemed to call GrfDrv directly to do fast screen
* writes (see note around g.done label).
*
*  16r2    2002/05/16  Boisy G. Pitre
* Removed pshs/puls of b from sharable code segment for non-NitrOS-9 because it was
* not needed.
*
*  16r3    2002/08/16  Boisy G. Pitre
* Now uses V$DRIVEX.
*
*  16r4    2004/07/12  Boisy G. Pitre
* 6809 version now calls the FAST TEXT entry point of GrfDrv.
*
*  17      2010/01/15  Boisy G. Pitre
* Fix for bug described in Artifact 2932883 on SF
* Also added Level 1 conditionals for eventual backporting

*
*  17      2010/01/15  Boisy G. Pitre
* Handling of device exclusivity using the SHARE. bit has been rearchitected.
* The '93 patch looked at the mode bytes in the descriptor and driver and
* determined that if both were set, then only one path would be allowed to
* be opened on the device at a time.
* I now believe this is wrong.
* The mode bytes in the device driver and descriptor are capability bytes.
* They advertise what the device is capable of doing (READ, WRITE, etc) so
* the mode bytes alone do not convey action, but merely what is possible.
* When the user calls I$Open on a device, he passes the desired mode byte
* in RegA and IOMan checks to make sure that all bits in that register are
* set in the mode bytes of the driver and descriptor.  So once we get into
* the Open call of this file manager, we know that all set bits in RegA are
* also set in the mode bytes of the driver and descriptor.
*
* For SHARE., what we SHOULD be doing is checking the number of open paths
* on the device.  If the SHARE. bit is set in RegA, then we check if a path
* is already open and if so, return the E$DevBsy error.
* Likewise, if SHARE. is not set in RegA, we check the path at the head of
* the open path list, and if ITS mode byte has the SHARE. bit set, we exit
* with E$DevBsy too.  The idea is that if the SHARE. bit is set on the newly
* opened path or an existing path, then there can "be only one."

* SCF has successfully been backported to NitrOS-9 Level 1.
* SCF now returns on carry set after calling SS.Open.  Prior to this
* change, SS.ComSt would be called right after SS.Open even if SS.Open
* failed. This caused misery with the scdwn driver wildcard feature.
*
* EOU Version 1.0.0
*          2022/08/01  LCB
* slight optimization in ReadLn chars when echo is turned on & a control
* code other than CR was received. Saves 2 bytes/3 cyc for that case (other
* chars no change. (L0418)
* 2 lbsr's changed to bsr's (both CPU's) - bsr L0403 in g.loop & bsr L0565 in L0634
