********************************************************************
* NGU - The "Next Great Utility"
*
* NGU is a template for writing utilities under OS-9/6809. It has
* robust option handling and is littered with comments to help you
* write your own utilities.
*
* NGU uses a two-pass method for parsing the command line.  On the
* first pass, dash options are processed and internal flags are set
* accordingly.  As the options are processed, they are cleared to
* spaces so that they won't be present on the second pass.
*
*  e.g.
*       1st pass:   ngu -x foo1 -y foo2 -t=bar1 -ab
*       2nd pass:   ngu    foo1    foo2
*
* For the second pass, NGU parses the remaining arguments, which don't
* begin with -. Presumably these are filenames or other names that are to be
* processed.
*
* Features:
*    - Written for 6809 and 6309 processors in fast, compact
*      assembly language.
*
*    - Both options and files can be specified anywhere
*      on the command line
*          (i.e ngu -a test1 -b test2 -c=foo)
*
*    - Multiple options can be combined behind one dash:
*          (i.e ngu -ab test1 -c=foo test2 test3)
*
*    - Several useful assembly routines are provided for
*      copying strings and determining string length.
*
* Limitations:
*    - Only single character option names can be processed.
*      Multi-character option names (i.e. -delete) aren't supported.
*
*    - The current file counter is one byte, counting a maximum
*      of 255 files.

* These vars are used by the base template and shouldn't be removed

* Here's how registers are set when this process is forked:

*   !   Data Area     !
*   +-----------------+

*   +-----------------+  <-- U, DP       (lowest address)
*
*   D = parameter area size
*  PC = module entry point abs. address
*  CC = F=0, I=0, others undefined

* The start of the program is here.
* Before any command line processing is done, we clear out
* our static memory from U to cleartop, then determine the
* size of our data area (minus the stack).
