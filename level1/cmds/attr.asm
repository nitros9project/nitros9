;;; attr
;;;
;;; Syntax:	attr <filename> [permission]
;;; Function: Examine or change a file's security permissions.
;;; Parameters:
;;;     filename    The name of the file to examine or change.
;;;     permission  One or more file attributes to apply.
;;; Options:
;;;     -d   Changes a file directory file to not a non-directory file.
;;;      s   The file is not single-user and can serve only one user at a time.
;;;      r   Only the owner can read the file.
;;;      w   Only the owner can write to the file.
;;;      e   Only the owner can execute the file.
;;;     pr   Anyone can read the file.
;;;     pw   Anyone can write to the file.
;;;     pe   Anyone can execute the file.
;;;     -a   Don't display attributes when modifying.
;;;
;;; Notes
;;;
;;; Type the command name followed by the name of the file you want to change. Next, type a list of the permissions
;;; to turn on or off. Turn a permission on by typing its abbreviation or off by typing its abbreviation preceded
;;; by a dash. attr has no effect on permissions you don't specify.
;;;
;;; If you don't specify any permissions, attr displays the file's current attributes. You can't change the
;;; attributes of a file you don't own. User 0 can change the attributes of any file in the system.
;;;
;;; Use attr to change a directory into a file after deleting all the directory's files. You can't change a
;;; file to a directory with attr. Use makdir instead.
;;;
;;; Examples
;;;
;;;  To remove public read and write permission from the file myfile, type:
;;;
;;;      attr myfile -pr -pw [ENTER]
;;;
;;; To give read, write, and execute permission to everyone for the file myfile, type:
;;;
;;;      attr myfile r we pr pw pe [ENTER]
;;;
;;; To display the current permissions of the file datalog, type:
;;;
;;;      attr datalog [ENTER]
