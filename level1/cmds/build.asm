;;; build
;;;
;;; Syntax: build <filename>
;;; Function: Builds a text file by copying input from the standard input device (the keyboard) into the file specified by filename.
;;; Parameters:
;;;      filename    The name of the file you're creating.
;;;
;;; Notes
;;;
;;; build creates the file, then displays a question mark (?) and waits for you to type a line. When you type a line and press [ENTER], build writes the line to the disk.
;;; When you finish entering the lines for the new file, press [ENTER] without any preceding text to close the file and terminate the operation.
;;; The following example demonstrates how to build a text file named newfile:
;;;
;;;      build newfile [ENTER]
;;;      ? THE POWERS OF THE OS-9 [ENTER]
;;;      ? OPERATING SYSTEM ARE TRULY [ENTER]
;;;      ? FANTASTIC. [ENTER]
;;;      ? [ENTER]
;;;
;;; To view the newly created file, type:
;;;
;;;      list newfile [ENTER]
;;;
;;; The screen displays:
;;;
;;;      THE POWERS OF THE OS-9
;;;      OPERATING SYSTEM ARE TRULY
;;;      FANTASTIC.
;;;
;;; Examples
;;;
;;; To create a new file called small_file and put into it whatever you type at the keyboard, type:
;;;
;;;      build small_file [ENTER]
;;;
;;; To direct whatever you type to the printer, type:
;;;
;;;      build /p [ENTER]
;;;
;;; You can use build to transfer, or redirect, data from one file to another. Instead of the keyboard, this example uses a file named mytext file for the input device. The output device is Terminal 1.
;;;
;;;      build â€¹mytext /t1 [ENTER]
