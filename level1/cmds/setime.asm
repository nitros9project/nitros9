********************************************************************
* Setime - Set Date/Time
*
* This is a Setime for use when a Y2K compliant system is required.
*
* This is somewhat of a cheat in that any attempts to do a full
* 4 digit conversion on the entered date string would have
* seriously broken the nice, generally compact codeing of the
* original setime module.  I didn't want to do that, so I cheated
* and simply added one more byte to the date packet image it builds
* on the stack.  Its conversion algorithm does 2 digits per pass/byte
* so if you enter 1998 (You MUST now enter the year as a 4 digit
* value!), this image will have a $13 as itas first and unused
* digit, if you enter a 20xx date, it will be a $14.
*
* I check this value after the rest of the conversion is all
* done, and if its $14 (or more), an extra 100 ($64) is added to the
* os9 year byte before the system F$STime call is made, pointing
* the F$STime call at only the normal 6 byte packet of time data.
*
* I've played with this maybe 20 minutes.  Hopefully you can use
* this into the next century without any further concerns about
* the "Y2K" problem.
