* Date - Print Date/Time
*
* Greetings;                                     September 25, 1996
*
* This 'Date' module, date5, has been expanded a wee bit to
* make it smart enough to handle dates to the year 2099.
*
* In order to have it do it in a math conversion, I would have had to
* make the 8 bit math it does into 16 bit, and there aren't enough
* registers in the 6809 to pull that off in a reasonable code size.
* So it still does 8 bit math, but only has a 1900-2099 year total
* range.  This is more than the recently converted clock for the Disto
* 4n1 I just uploaded, as that clock now has a range from 1980 to 2079.
* A simple subtraction determines if it prints a leading 20, and the
* contents of the register after the subtraction, or it reloads the
* string pointer to point at 19 and reloads the year register to get
* the year 00-99 to print.
*
* This contains no 6309 specific code, so Nitros9 and a 6309 cpu
* are not required to use it, box stock is fine.
