* Dump - Show file contents in hex
*
* Dump follows the function of the original Microware version but now
* supports large files over 64K, and is free from the problems of garbage
* in wide listings.
*
* In addition it now allows dumping of memory modules and command modules
* in the execution directory.

* From Tandy OS-9 Level One VR 02.00.00.
*
*   6      2002/12/23  Boisy G. Pitre
* Incorporated R. Telkman's additions from 1987, added -d option,
* added defs to conditionally assemble without help or screen size check.
*
*          2003/01/17  Boisy G. Pitre
* Removed -d option.
*
*          2003/01/21  Boisy G. Pitre
* Narrow screen now shows properly, only dumps 16 bits worth of address
* data to make room.
*
*          2003/03/03  Boisy G. Pitre
* Fixed bug where header would be shown even if there was no data in a file.
*
*   7      2003/06/06  Rodney V. Hamilton
* Restored Rubout processing for terminals.
*
*   8      2022/11/21-27  L. Curtis Boyle
* Fixed bug where it will not allow filenames with '-' chars in them to open
* Also shrunk option parsing code & more fully commented source

* 6809/6309 - could do puls a here, then rts instead of puls. Or save A in DP (faster)
