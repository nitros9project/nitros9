* SSPak - Speech-Sound Pak Text-To-Speech Driver
*
* by Bruce Isted (CIS 76625,2273)
* released to the Public Domain 87/05/03
*
*    This driver supports only the Speech-Sound Pak's text-to-speech mode.
* Bit 7 is cleared and control codes are filtered to ensure that only carriage
* returns and characters in the range of $20-$7F (inclusive) are passed.  A
* character count and automatic buffer flush is used, which should prevent
* buffer overflow in the Speech-Sound Pak.
*
*    Due to way the COCO's sound select circuitry is tied in with other sound
* sources and the joysticks, only one will function at a time.  This means
* that while the Speech-Sound Pak is active other sound sources and/or the
* joysticks cannot be used.  Speech output is enabled only when a carriage
* return is received, or when the buffer is flushed.  Speech output is
* disabled as soon as the Speech-Sound Pak is finished speaking the string
* received before the carriage return or buffer flush.
