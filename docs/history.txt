As the decades pass, we will lose some of the history of how we got to
where we are.  This file is to help us remember, even if it records bits
and pieces, rather than a whole story.

NitrOS9 was started by @Bill Nobel , Wes Gale and myself (although I was
a few days later than the other two), and then Alan Dekok joined in later
as well. OS-9 "Level 3", as Alan called it, was his way to expand system
memory, although it won't work with DriveWire at all in it's current state
(Bill was looking into the at one point). Version 3 was the one by over
a dozen developers in the late 1980's and was planned to be sold through
Tandy. The main head of that project was Kevin Darling, and a version of
it was released by Brother Jeremy, but it's not the most advanced version
that Kevin talked about in his history of the project. Some of it has made
it into NitrOS9 (some directly ported like GShell, serial mouse drivers,
etc.) and some clean room style (original code but same functionality)
and other parts are not in NitrOS9 currently.
